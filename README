Hello, this repository describes the work I've completed during my internship. I recently began an internship at Next Gen Tech Services, focusing on backend development in Node.js.

My first task, assigned on March 19th, involved implementing CRUD operations using Mongoose. Through this task, I gained an understanding of connecting to MongoDB Atlas and other related functionalities.
CRUD operations consist of Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations, which are essential for interacting with a database.

The following day, I successfully implemented functionalities for uploading, retrieving, deleting, and updating images using Postman and MongoDB. This involved creating API endpoints to handle each of these image-related operations.

On March 21st, I was assigned the task of developing login and sign-up APIs with JWT token authentication. I completed this task on the same day, ensuring secure user authentication processes.

Continuing on March 22nd, I implemented APIs for the "forgot password" and "reset password" functionalities, utilizing Nodemailer to send emails for password recovery, thereby enhancing user experience and security.

On March 23rd, I integrated API keys into my project to enhance security measures and control access to APIs, bolstering overall security protocols within the application.

March 24th and 25th were holidays.

On March 26th, I expanded my knowledge by learning to integrate Socket.IO using Node.js.

On March 27th I implementing private chat messages in Node.js using Socket.IO.

On March 28th, I focused on implementing disconnection handling and storing messages in Socket.IO, improving the robustness of the chat functionality.

on March 29th, I successfully integrated Razorpay Payment Gateway into the Node.js application, enabling secure online payment processing.
